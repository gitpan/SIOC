SIOC

This Perl class distribution implements the SIOC ontology, enabling community
platforms like weblogs or bulletin boards to export their information in a
machine-readable format.

The SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities) Core Ontology provides
the main concepts and properties required to describe information from online
communities (e.g., message boards, wikis, weblogs, etc.) on the Semantic Web.

This distribution implements the various SIOC subclasses like SIOC::Site,
SIOC::User, SIOC::Forum or SIOC::Post. It also contains an exporter class
(SIOC::Exporter) that Perl-based community software can use to generate a
semantic RDF representation of its data.
